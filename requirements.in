# We have a fork of the bdd-tester repo, in order to add a single commit that
# fixes the previous commit we were using, to work with the new pip resolver.
#
# This means the behaviour with the new pip resolver will be the same as
# what happened with the old resolver (where subsequent requirements were
# silently ignored).
#
# We really shouldn't do any more work on this fork, and should instead update
# to the latest upstream version of bdd-tester, which also fixes this
# requirements issue.
# We've not done this yet because this requires changes to cove, and some
# careful testing, which we currently don't have time to do.

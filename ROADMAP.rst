Roadmap
=======

Jan - March 2016
In three months time CoVE will:

* Be live for OCDS validator (end of Jan 2016)
* Start on the process of separating the 360Giving and OCDS versions of the tool
* Deal differently with JSON users and spreadsheet users
* Validate other formats directly (e.g csvs as csvs, excel as excel)
* Have improved error messages
* Show - Fields not being used/'coverage' for 360 Giving based on spreadsheet on the website.
* Have a lovely 360page... ...and a lovely OCDS page
* Use Whoosh - python text search? - This should be a big  help with exploring your data
* Show some graphs and maps
* Have a Large files policy - we need to decide how we handle them, and tell people how we handle them - need to say we have a time out now.
* Be available for offline use - i.e offering CoVE as a python library
* Have a roadmap for Flatten Tool - a core componant
* Have Transifex integration for translations
* Have a key facts panel for 360giving - schema used, date you did it etc

Maybe:

* How does it do a single function...Validate only - split validate/flatten (as a config option?)
* Work with IATI data.
* Custom quick and easy deployment.
* A 360 specific deploy on 360Giving domain


We have discussed but will not be doing the following in the forseable future:

* Comparison - see the difference between files
* Multiple files - upload many files at once and deal with them either collectively or individually
* Provides a merge releases feature for OCDS data
* Do we want a queue?
* "API" on validation / warnings / aggregate data
* Button to download a CSV/JSON of results
* When to use and when not - ipython notebooks, sql output, (part of this is moving cove into a library)
* We don't think it should become a datastore...
* Widget to let people embed links to converted data in their own websites (e.g. user publishers as CSV, but tags the link so that JSON and Excel links also provided);
